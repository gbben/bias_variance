# Bias Variance

A set of simulations and a guide through the topic of Bias and Variance and Generalisation error. Focusing on how neural models and more classical models compare, when competing on as "equal" fotting as possible. 

First part goes through the basics of Bias Variance decomposition. Second part will discuss the more modern phenomena and how the concept of complexity is unclear. Third part will discuss experiments that show the behaviour of neural models isn't that different from regression models, in some regards.
